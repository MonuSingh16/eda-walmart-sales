# <h1 align="center" id="heading">EDA with Walmart Sales (Automating & Manual)</h1>


## Business Objective

Walmart, the retail giant that operates a chain of hypermarkets, wants to understand their weekly sales data, especially the impact from holidays and big events; specifically, Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. In addition, Walmart wants to consider the effect from different macroeconomic and external factors on the weekly sales.

We will in the end also create a simple linear regression model with preporcessor done via `sklearn.pipeline`

*Note: if you see code that's unfamiliar to you, look up for the documentation, and try to understand what it does.*

## :hammer_and_wrench: Pre-Work

1. activate your `conda` environment; replace `venv-eda` with the name of your `conda` environment (`conda env list` to see all available environments)
    ```
    conda activate venv-eda
    ```
2. install the required packages under the current directory: `{Your Local Directory}/`
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. We will be doing EDA both manual way and by sweetviz
    ```
    pip install sweetviz
    ```
